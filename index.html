            <p>
                Orpheus with his lute made trees<br>
                And the mountain tops that freeze<br>
                Bow themselves when he did sing.<br>
                To his music plants and flowers<br>
                Ever sprung; as sun and showers<br>
                There had made a lasting spring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every thing that heard him play,<br>
                Even the billows of the sea,<br>
                Hung their heads and then lay by.<br>
                In sweet music is such art,<br>
                Killing care and grief of heart<br>
                Fall asleep, or hearing, die.
            </p>
